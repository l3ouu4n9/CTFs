## Description:
I made a chat application. <br>Any messages are encrypted, so it's very secure.

FYI:  Alice sends FLAG to bob every 30 seconds.

================================<br>
update: there was a mistake in 3233<br> challenge that makes it a little bit easier.<br> If you want to try patched version you can use<br> chall-3233-patched.tar.gz on http://34.84.7.213/ ,<br> but since previous version was already solved by some teams,<br> old version is still available with same flag.
