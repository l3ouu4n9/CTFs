# Proof-of-Work
## Description:
<br>
<center>Hello Hacker!<br><br> In this challenge you simply need to solve a proof-of-work. The proof-of-work will be the same for most of the challenges, so we provide you with a template in Python to solve it. Simply run it to get this flag.<br><br>
This solver is not the fastest possible, so you can write your own, but you won't receive any support on it.<br><br>
You can solve the challenge manually at:<br> <code>nc challs.m0lecon.it 1337</code><br><br>
	Happy Hacking!</center>
