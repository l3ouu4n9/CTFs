The notorious company CorpoFun , the place to go for workplace fun, has been compromised !

But the only clue the security engineers have been able to find is a seemingly ordinary PDF, sent over the Internet. Uncover its secrets, and get the flag !
**Note : if you have any trouble opening the PDF, please use either Firefox or SumatraPDF (open source FTW)**
