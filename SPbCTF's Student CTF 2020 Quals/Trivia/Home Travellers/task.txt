I miss travelling so very very much!

Can you make me feel a bit more free and welcome?

Greet me with a photo of your team solving Student CTF 2020 in a warm home environment, and I'll reward you with a flag worth one point! Фыр!

Please send the pics to my agent Kseniya: Telegram @ksvark or E-mail ksvark@gmail.com — and don't forget to specify your team name
