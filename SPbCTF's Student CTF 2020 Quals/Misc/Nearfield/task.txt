I found some strange access control system. It refuses to let me through because my social credit score is too low, but I managed to capture how my card communicates with the reader.

Your job is to create a dump of a valid passcard (with 31337 social score) and upload it here: nearfield.student2020tasks.ctf.su/

Card exchange capture: nearfield.txt

Added at 16:40: here you have a Mifare Classic 1K communication dump taken with a proxmark3 device (https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3). NXP Mifare datasheet (http://www.orangetags.com/wp-content/downloads/datasheet/NXP/Mifare%20EV1%201K.pdf) might be handy.
