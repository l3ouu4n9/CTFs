# Tripping_Breakers
## Description:
Attached is a forensics capture of an HMI (human machine interface) containing scheduled tasks, registry hives, and user profile of an operator account. There is a scheduled task that executed in April 2021 that tripped various breakers by sending DNP3 messages. We would like your help clarifying some information. What was the IP address of the `substation_c`, and how many total breakers were tripped by this scheduled task? Flag format: flag{IP-Address:# of breakers}. For example if `substation_c`'s IP address was `192.168.1.2` and there were 45 total breakers tripped, the flag would be flag{192.168.1.2:45}.
