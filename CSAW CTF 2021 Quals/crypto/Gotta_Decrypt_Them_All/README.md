# Gotta_Decrypt_Them_All
## Description:
You are stuck in another dimension while you were riding Solgaleo. You have Rotom-dex with you to contact your friends but he won't activate the GPS unless you can prove yourself to him. He is going to give you a series of phrases that only you should be able to decrypt and you have a limited amount of time to do so. Can you decrypt them all?
