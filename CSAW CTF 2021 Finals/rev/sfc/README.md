## Description:
After safecore was compromised in CSAW quals, the Schlami in the OSIRIS Lab have come up with the Spectral Finite Core! Three wrong attempts at going to _emode_ and the core bricks. Oh, and SFC also has branch prediction, a HW perf counter to count cycles, and a cache which make it super-cool. Take that, ChipZilla.
