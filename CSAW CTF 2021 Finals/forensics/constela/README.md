## Description:
The year is 7331, and BadCorp rules the galaxy with its omnipresent satellites. But recently a resistance movement led by a band of hackers calling themselves the OSIRIS has hacked into BadCorp systems! They have taken over the satellites and it is believed they are trying to send a message across the galaxy...can humanity _see_ their message?
