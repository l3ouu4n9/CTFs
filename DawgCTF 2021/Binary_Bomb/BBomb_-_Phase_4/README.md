# BBomb_-_Phase_4
## Description:
This is the phase you have been waiting for... one may say it's the golden stage!

Let's switch things up! Numerical inputs map to line numbers in rockyou.txt, and each word is separated by a '_' (if the phase's solution is 4 5, the flag would be DawgCTF{password_iloveyou})
