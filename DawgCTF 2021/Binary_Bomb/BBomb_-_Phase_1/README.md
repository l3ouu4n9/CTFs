# BBomb_-_Phase_1
## Description:
Welcome to the CyberDawgs Binary Bomb challenge series! The "bbomb" binary contains a series of mini reversing challenges broken into 9 phases.  Each phase becomes incresingly more difficult, but it is not required to solve a phase to move onto the next.  Simply press enter for a phase's input to skip it.  Additionally, known phase solutions can be stored in a file named "flags.txt".  See the binary's welcome message for the format and requirements.  When submitting to this scoreboard, wrap the phase's solution in DawgCTF{}.  Happy reversing!

Starting off easy... reversing (things) is fun!
