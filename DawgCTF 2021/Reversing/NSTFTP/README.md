## Description:
Hey, I know it's 6pm on Friday, but we have a quick request for you. The original author of this software was known to insert backdoors. We need you to find and trigger any backdoors in this software. Oh, and we lost our copy of the client. Hopefully this old pcap the network admin had laying around will be enough. It's a pcap of someone connecting to the server and downloading files. You might be able to find the original binaries on that server somewhere.
