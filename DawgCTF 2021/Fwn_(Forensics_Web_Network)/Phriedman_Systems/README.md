# Phriedman_Systems
## Description:
We want access to the CEO's secure data. Log in to their website using the CEO's account.
https://phriedmansystems.onrender.com/

Hints:
- This is primarily a Recon challenge.
- There is NO password cracking, brute force, or password guessing required.
- There is NO steganography of any sort required.
- The onrender.com website is just used for hosting. Attacking Render is not a part of the challenge; do not attack Render or attempt to break into the backend.
- You don't need to use anything on the Internet at all apart from phriedmansystems.onrender.com.
