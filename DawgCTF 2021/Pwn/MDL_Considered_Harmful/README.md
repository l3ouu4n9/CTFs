# MDL_Considered_Harmful
## Description:
There's a bot named MDLChef in the Discord. You need to DM it, it doesn't respond in the server. On its host machine, there's a file at /opt/flag.txt - it contains the flag. Go get it. 

Note: This is NOT an OSINT challenge. The source code really isn't available. Good luck.
