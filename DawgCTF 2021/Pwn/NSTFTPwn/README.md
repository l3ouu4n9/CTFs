# NSTFTPwn
## Description:
It turns out that the guy that wrote the backdoor in NSTFTP wasn't a great C programmer either, and we think his code has bugs. Can you prove it by exploiting the server and running flag_printer? We'll need that flag to prove it's vulnerable. (Note, binary and libc are both available over NSTFTP.)
