## Description:
At some point during this recording, a plane with tail number ~~N5928H~~ **NE928H** landed on a lake. The flag is the name of the lake it landed on. Example: If it landed on "Lake Ontario", the flag would be DawgCTF{Ontario}.

*EDIT: The tail number was a typo. The tail number you should be looking for is **NE928H**.*

NOTE! The Cyberdawgs aviation office runs HackRFs, so this IQ file was saved in *HackRF* format (complex, with 8bit signed integer I and 8bit signed integer Q). That format's a bit of an oddball, so you may need to convert it to something else.
