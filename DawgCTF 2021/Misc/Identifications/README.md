## Description:
*Hey man. I'm standing in front of this Verizon central office building. What's its CLLI code?*

*What? No, I don't know where I am, my GPS is broken. I tried to connect to some Wi-Fi so I could download a map or something, but I don't know the password to any of these networks.*

Once you figure out the CLLI code, make sure to wrap it in DawgCTF{}.
