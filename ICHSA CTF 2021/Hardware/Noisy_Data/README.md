## Description:
Our gaming console securely communicates with a remote server to download games following a user's purchase. The secret key used for decrypting the games is locally stored on a secure hardware. Digital rights management (DRM) is a systematic approach to copyright protection for digital media. The purpose of DRM is to prevent unauthorized redistribution of digital media and restrict the ways consumers can copy content they've purchased. 

Our goal is to break the DRM system deployed on our gaming console and extract the secret key. Fortunately, physical parameters are revealed by a hardware during the processing. Those are called side channels. One example of a side channel is the power consumption which can be measured while a secret key is in use. Power analysis is one technique for secret key extraction given the measured power traces.

Before we collect a massive amount of power traces from our gaming console, we need to find the most leaky point to measure from. Therefore, we collected dozens of power traces from different physical locations (those are grouped in 20 different folders). Unfortunately, some contain information related to the secret key, but some do not.

Your mission is to point to the relevant folders.

Each folder contains two files of power traces:

1. Group 0: a list of equal sized power traces which were collected while the AES engine was triggered given key = 0x00

2. Group 1:  a list of equal sized power traces which were collected while the AES engine was triggered given key = 0xFF



The flag is the folders ID: ICHSA_CTF{ID1_ID2_ID3_...} 

IDs order from lower to higher
