# Secure_TPM
## Description:
We have the most secure TPM Hardware!

Somehow our HW decryption is not working anymore

We bought new one but we must use the same key to decrypt our old files

I tried to play with it a little, but I think I did more harm than good, but reset can recover the TPM original key.

Please use your black cyber magic and help us extarct the key from our old TPM HW

Don't forget to submit your flag with `ICHSA_CTF{the_secret_key}`
