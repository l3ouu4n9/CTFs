# VOODOO_Fault_Injections
## Description:
We've noticed the NSA is broadcasting a weird encrypted message repeatedly.
So, we hired a shaman to help us extract the key of the encrypted message.
The shaman did his work told us something like: "Using my black magic voodoo sh*t I've managed to zeroed out a different byte  every broadcast, the byte was zeroed out in the data before the last AES 128 ECB sub-bytes round... I've also summoned a file called FLAG.enc".
We told him: "WTF?!? Where is our key? We paid you a lot of money!".
Anyway, we've manged to intercept 16 weird different broadcasts. Please help us retrieve the key.
