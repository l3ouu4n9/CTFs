## Description:
It's seems the damn Empire got more serious about security, who could have predicated that?

The last mission was a total failure the team barely got back in one piece. I have interviewed the team's Astromech as per High-Command orders. It turns out that not only the Empire rotated their keys as usual, they apparently replaced the defective SonyTech's authorization-code-signer module! That must have cost them a lot, well they have the credits and manpower to do this - sorry not important right now.

High-Command is worried that the Alliance is in for a very rough time ahead. They gave me an order to find a solution to our cyber-predicament but also told me to keep quite so moral would stay high.

Good news! A Fulcrum agent got his hands on the new model - months ego! I got it two hours ego, it is marked as RFC6979 and looks like a retro fitted Coder-6979 from the Clone-Wars area, they used P-384-SHA-384 module internally if I remember corretly. It seems to give deterministic signatures as the pervious model but it is not vulnerable as the pervious model.

Unfortunately while I was having a meal in the mess hall to eat and ponder on solving our dire cyber-situation the model was destroyed by a couple of stray blaster blots when a spy was apprehended. The goodish news? The logs of my automatic testing survived! Maybe you can help me squeeze another win against the evil Empire?
