# Not_My_Fault
## Description:
"I have no idea how they decrypted the message! Honestly! I used really advanced encryption standards! I never gave anyone else the key! It's not my fault, I swear!"

Looks like someone is performing a fault injection attack, and every attempt zeroes a random bit in the key.
