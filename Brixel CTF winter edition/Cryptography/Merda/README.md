## Description:
<p>An Italian messenger was caught during the war<p>
<p>He was carrying a piece of paper that read: <i>ymj kqfl nx gwncjqHYK{uneefsfutqn}</i></p>
<p>Upon torturing the messenger for an explaination, he gestured a V with his fingers. The english guard took it as an insult and killed him right on the spot.</p>
<p>Maybe he just wanted some peace?</p>
