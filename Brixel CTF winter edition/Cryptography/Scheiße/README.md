## Description:
<p>A german messenger was caught during WW2<p>
<p>He was carrying a piece of paper that read: <i>qbhbh zrmua gfbld ocqbv</i></p>
<p>He was nice enough to give us all we wanted, except the decoded message, he needs a special machine for that, and we don't have it.</p>
<p>He DID give us the settings for the machine.</p>
<p>The settings for this machine are:</p>
<p>Model: G-312</p>

<p>Rotor 1: 2/12/6</p>
<p>Rotor 2: 1/17/16</p>
<p>Rotor 3: 3/12/1</p>
<p>The flag is ONE word, no spaces. do NOT translate the flag!</p>
