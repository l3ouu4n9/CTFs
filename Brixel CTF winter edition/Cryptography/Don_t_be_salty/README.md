## Description:
<p>Our l33t hackers hacked a bulletin board and gained access to the database. We need to find the admin password.</p>
<p>The user's database info is:</p>
<p><b>Username:</b>admin</p>
<p><b>Passwordhash:</b>2bafea54caf6f8d718be0f234793a9be</p>
<p><b>Salt:</b>04532@#!!</p>
<br>
<p>We know from the source code that the salt is put AFTER the password, then hashed. We also know the user likes to use lowercase passwords of only 5 characters long.</p>
<p>The flag is the plaintext password.</p>
<p><b>This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format</b></p>
