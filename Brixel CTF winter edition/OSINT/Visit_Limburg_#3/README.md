## Description:
<p>While hiking on the BE-MINE hill on 18 december 2020 I noticed a big cargo plane with 4 props flying over, it looked like it had militairy markings.</p>
<p>I tried to find out what plane it was but failed. Can you help me out? I bet it came from one of the military airbases nearby.</p>
<p>I need the registration number, model, and month & year of registration.</p>
<p>Syntax: brixelCTF{registrationnumber+model+month(MM)+year(YY)}</p>
