## Description:
<p>I'm supposed to meet up with my buddy who supplies me with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_(warez)">Twilight</a> cd's but he's very cryptic about the meeting location.</p>
<p>He told me he will meet under a bridge that sits in the middle of a triangle of 3 locations.</p>
<p>The first two locations are the two mineshafts of the coalmines in the province that are the furthest appart from each other.</p>
<p>The third location is where the provided (hazy) picture was taken</p>
<p>Please provide the date that was written under the bridge (format #.##.## where # is a digit) in 2013</p>
<p><b>This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format</b></p>
