## Description:
<p>Welcome to Limburg! This beatiful province of Belgium offers so much to see and do!</p>
<p>Let's say you want to take a nice bike ride from one side to the other, but don't want to drive too much on roads where there are a lot of cars driving.</p>
<p>For this purpose we have a bike network! It tries to guide you as much as possible over smaller roads and bike paths where cars  are not allowed to drive.</p>
<p>Let's start here: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maastrichtersteenweg+201,+3770+Riemst/@50.8333603,5.637255,15.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c0e88b020d50a5:0x81a9e3b139856acb!8m2!3d50.8316796!4d5.6442194">Google maps link</a> and end here: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Steenstortstraat,+3581+Beringen/@51.078121,5.2380936,16.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c13016b7f3699f:0xcf71d3a220658e79!8m2!3d51.0784705!4d5.2415842">Google maps link</a>.</p>
<p>The flag is the sum of all the nodes you pass on your trip (including the start and end nodes!)</p>
<p>Happy cycling!</p>
<p><b>This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format</b></p>
