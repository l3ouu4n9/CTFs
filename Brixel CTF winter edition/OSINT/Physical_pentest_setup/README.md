## Description:
<p>So we're going to try to install a 'bug' at the local police office of the city of Halen (BE)</p>
<p>The plan is to disguise ourselves as technicians of their telecom provider, but who is that?</p>
<p><b> do NOT call them to get the information, you can find everything you need online! It's a criminal offence to bother them with nonsense like this and you could get in trouble for it. </b></p>

<p><b>This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format</b></p>
