## Description:
<p>This is a challenge to test your basic programming skills.</p>
<br>
<p>Pseudo code:</p>
<p>Set X = 1</p>
<p>Set Y = 1</p>
<p>Set previous answer = 1</p>
<br>
<p>answer = X * Y + previous answer + 3</p>
<br>
<p>After that => X + 1 and Y + 1 ('answer' becomes 'previous answer') and repeat this till you have X = 525.</p>
<br>
<p>The final answer is the value of 'answer' when X = 525. Fill it in below.</p>
<br>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>5 = 1 * 1 + 1 + 3</p>
<p>12 = 2 * 2 + 5 + 3</p>
<p>24 = 3 * 3 + 12 + 3</p>
