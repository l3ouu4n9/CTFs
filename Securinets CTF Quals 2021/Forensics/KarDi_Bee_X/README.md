## Description:
I downloaded a file from my friend but it turned out that it is very suspicious.
I found him that day opening my pc, i have no idea how he managed to get the password.Not only my password tho, everything.
He changed the password and used it to protect a file containing access to my secret file. But it's hashed now ... help me !

PS : **<97> = 1 <98> = 2 ...**
