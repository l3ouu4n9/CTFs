# Bypass_TheEmperor's_guards
## Description:
TheEmperor created an HTML form where he was trying to show that he can store his password there without any risk thanks to his faithful guards that will prevent anyone from getting access to the flag.

For simplicity reason, he knows that obfuscating so much the code would decrease its performance. That's why he only remained on his guards and for another simplicity reason, he didn't want to put a compact code (the code is beautified) since the objective is to test how powerful are his guards.

Now, bypass TheEmperor's guards and get a full access to the empire with his mighty flag.
