<br/>
Someone is bullying a fan account of the happy little con! We have managed to get some information about the accounts in question.<br/>
<br/>
--Scope--<br/>
- The account <i>being</i> bullied is mutuals with Circle City Con, and they are only following Circle City Con.<br/>
- The bullying account only has 3 tweets which are all from the past 5 days.<br/>
- The tags of both accounts are related to circle city con, and <i>its theme!</i><br/>
<br/>
Flag format is CCC{...} and begins with `wh` (just so things dont get out of order)<br/>
