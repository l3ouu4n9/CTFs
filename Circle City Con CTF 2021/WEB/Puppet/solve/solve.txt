Abuse Chrome DevTools Protocol (https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/)


The flag is at
```
file:///home/inmate/Documents/flag_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.txt
```

The debugging port is
```
--remote-debugging-port=5000
```

No Same-Origin Policy and CSP because of
```
--disable-web-security
```

Solution
```
1. Use the DevTools protocol to open file:///home/inmate/Documents and fetch document.body.textContent through the WebSocket
2. Parse the HTML to get the filename of the flag, then use the same technique to read the file contents.
