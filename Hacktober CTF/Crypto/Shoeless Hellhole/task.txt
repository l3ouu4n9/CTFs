Have you taken a look at Ghost Town lately? It sounds like DEADFACE met up earlier this week. They gave an address, but that doesn't look like any address I've ever seen before. I bet it's an encrypted message. See if you can find out how to decrypt the message. Submit the name of the location as the flag (Example: flag{Empire State Building})

Here's the message: 1c0b4f9a4c18130dc631186fd7356bd1e7ca8f75623382bca6aaa60d9482785d
