It seems spookyboi still wants proof you're a top-notch programmer. He wants you to create a program that returns one number on the first line, then two consecutive numbers on the second line, then three consecutive numbers on the third line, and so forth. Here's an example:

1
2 3
4 5 6
He wants you to start with 666 and give 30 rows.
