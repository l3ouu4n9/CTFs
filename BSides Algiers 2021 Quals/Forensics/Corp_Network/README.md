Description:
a company suspects a targeted attack, after network administrators reported some unusual network traffic, after a first investigation,
they found an sd-card in an employer's desk, the sd-card contained only a single binary file named `inject.bin`.

We believe this attack is targeted, as such, it might not be easy to reproduce it on a lab environment, for this challenge, your goal is to find out how to get it to produce the malicious behaviour.

The flag is : `shellmates{string_you_found}`, where `string_you_found` is replaced with the string you found while analyzing it.

Note: This challenge consists of two parts, the second one will become accessible when you'll solve this part.
