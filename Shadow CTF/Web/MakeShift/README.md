# MakeShift
## Description:
A lot of the time developers tend to use makeshift code that just works and not necessarily secure. This is the reason for most data breaches in web applications. Can you find a vulnerability and get the flag in this php web application?

**Flag format**: ShadowCtf{fl4g_h3r3}
