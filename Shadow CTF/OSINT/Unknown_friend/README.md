## Description:
At one summer night I have received an unnamed letter with a  postcard. Anonymous penfriend was inviting me to meet him. I  thought Why not?, but there was no return address, neither the  photo of a friend, neither the name 
So I started looking for him with the help of the photo he sent to me. 
Can you find the name and the surname of my anonymous pen  friend? 

The photo from the postcard was taken in 2016 (author is my  penfriend, by the way). But since that the place did not change at  all.
It is said that all the countries in Africa are poor. However, they  are developing very fast, especially because of the tourism  industry. This industry is developed in the home country of our  penfriend, by the way. 
Here are some interesting facts (just in case if you want to find  out, where the photo from the postcard was taken): 
-- This country has the lowest crime rate in Africa; 
-- There are huge chocolate tree plantations, beautiful green  valleys, sea tortoises;
-- My penfriend promised to share some food called Aranha with me;
-- Russian airline Aeroflot was the first company that organized a  flight to this country.
