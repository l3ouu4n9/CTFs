## Description:
*"How do you know a file does not contain any secret information for you Device. Antivirus are not always the best choice to go."*<br>
These lines are said by some unknown Cyber Hacker. Dont know why though. <br>
But my friends don't agree with this and sent me a recording of some Expert explaining serious stuff. I think the file has some issues. And also they said something about secret message which was **`B/aI*0PYV`** . 

Let's  Dig !
