# e-Management_System
## Description:
Lauren Smith has just joined as a legal counsellor for xyzcorp, she was assigned a desk which was earlier used by Will May. She has been requested to search out the existing user records of the company (which is hidden somewhere out on the company's e-Management System) in such a way that every search involves the date 1st january and the search should be between 2000 to 2020. 

Since the PC was earlier used by Will May, he used to do the search work as well but he forgot to clear all the browser data which means the existing values present on the browser would be of Will May so don't be confused!
