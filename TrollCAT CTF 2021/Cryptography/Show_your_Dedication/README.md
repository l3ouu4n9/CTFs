## Description:
For the last 11 months, James has been practicing for 5000m Marathon World Championship which is to be organised in Virginia, USA. James has running in his GENES and he has already won many laurels in National Events,
but this time he wants to win an international competition. But the day of the race was totally unexpected for him. Unlike normal races, in this race,
all the participants were told to run separately and their indvidual time will be recorded. Yet, to his surprise again, there was another rule. The participants were not told about 
where the finishing line was. The judges handed out a paper to everyone which was encoded in some way and apparantly this text had the destination of the race encoded in it.
James is not very good in solving cryptics but he knew that the KEY to this race is RACE itself.

The content of the paper is given below :-

Help James to decode the text and win the race.
