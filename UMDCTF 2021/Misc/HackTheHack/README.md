# HackTheHack
## Description:
This challenge is a little bit different, so read carefully. You are a 1337 h@ck0r trying to watch your favorite movie, Hackers (1995), within 5 minutes from now. To do so you need to socially engineer an TV operator in order to get them to change the scheduling. The TV operator will be played by UMDCTF developers and the call will be simulated using Discord DMs.

Rules:
The simulation starts when you type `------START [TEAM NAME]------`
The simulation ends when you type `------END------`, we type `------END------`, you are given you the flag, or 5 minutes passes from when you typed start
You can find who to dm by asking in the `#hack-the-hack` channel in our Discord using the mention `@hack the hack dev`
Please identify your team name when you ask who to dm
Do not attempt to contact any TV stations or operators about this challenge
All communication should be directed through official hack-the-hackers
You have three attempts to get the flag per team, each attempt starts when you type `------START [TEAM NAME]------`

Have fun!

The goal of this challenge is creativity, we will be playing a TV operator that is intentionally very gullible, so things are more likely to go well if the simulation is interesting.

You must join the Discord for this challenge! https://discord.gg/dDnQncKqzV
