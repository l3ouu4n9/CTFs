# Willow-RPI
## Description:
Raspberry Pi Zero baremetal programming is fun! No standard libs, no rules, pure chaos.

Both files are not required to download!

```
bootable-rpi0-phys-willow.img -- bootable image complete with rpi boot binaries/kernel, write-ready to sd card, use standard UART pins
kernel-rpi0-qemu-willow.img -- only kernel image ready for QEMU v5, load address differs from physical pi load address
```

Helpful things:

`qemu-system-arm -M raspi0 -kernel $(KERN).img -serial null -serial stdio` - run kernel in QEMU v5
