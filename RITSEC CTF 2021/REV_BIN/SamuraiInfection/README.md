## Description:
Hey Samurai, some corpo went catatonic in a local braindance den. His implants were all nonfunctional and it looks like something wiped him, unfortunately he was running some sort of archaic PortholeOS so we can't do anything to recover him. The halo however survived, looks like it was write protected before use. We pulled this off of it, see what you can make of it.

NOTE: This challenge uses a custom flag format of  RITSEC{}.

Hint:

A corpo body hit the floor
5678
the base drop didn't wait
ATGC
is that shorthand that I see
