BAP wasn't secure enough. Now the admin is a bit smarter, see if you can still get the flag! If you experience any issues, send it here [https://us-east1-dicegang.cloudfunctions.net/ctf-2021-admin-bot?challenge=build-a-better-panel]

NOTE: The admin will only visit sites that match the following regex ^https:\/\/build-a-better-panel\.dicec\.tf\/create\?[0-9a-z\-\=]+$
