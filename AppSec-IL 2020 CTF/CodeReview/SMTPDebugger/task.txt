Before you're trying to use our new SMTP Application,
We made you SMTP Debugger for you to fool around with our SDK.

The Format is:
Connect: nc smtpdebugger.appsecil.ctf.today 2525
Send input like:
{"from_addr": "from@addr.com", "to_addrs": "to@addr.com", "subject": "subject", "message": "message"}

We even attached the source for you to review....
Try to get the flag from our server!
