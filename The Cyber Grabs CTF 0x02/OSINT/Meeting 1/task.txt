thecybergrabs members called me for meeting where we were discussing about how to hide the flag and where to hide it securely. So I shared my idea with them about hiding it image file and place it somewhere safe.

Will you help us know if it is a secure place or not?

flag format: cyb3rg4abs{S0m3_t3xt}

Note: flag is divided into 2 parts

Hint: Have look in the every place and observe it clearly.
