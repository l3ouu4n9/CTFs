An employee on the network has been emailing these chess puzzles everyday to someone outside of the domain, and nobody really thought it was suspicious until they saw this weird string sent to that same person on the following day: 

F^mY;L?t24Zk.m^-hnWl,[l)[ku 

The SOC team has provided an archive of the email attachments, and has tasked you to investigate the actual contents of the ciphertext. Can you figure out what they've been saying?

Hint: The flag is wrapped in MetaCTF{}. This should be enough to help you figure out the encoding.
