Interested in the hot secret hidden in my basement? That's right, it's stored on this old computer. Unfortunately it stopped working a long time ago. However I've got an emulator that simulates this machine and I even was able to dump it's magnetic drum into a file. I'm sure that way extracting the juicy data should be easy, right?
