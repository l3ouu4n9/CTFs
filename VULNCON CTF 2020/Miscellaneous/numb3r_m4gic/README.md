Description:
I just love numbers. Today, I have puzzle for you.
```
R1:[4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49]
R2:[13, 16, 14, 16, 22]
R3:[11, 12, 12, 11]
R4:[5, 6, 5]
R5:[11, 11]
R6:[4]
```
Observe the pattern and generate the same when:-
R1 = [25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, 441, 484, 529, 576, 625]

Save the output to a file called 'answer.txt', and generate its md5sum hash and submit it as follows...
Submit your answers here: `nc 35.223.124.128 1337`

**Note: There's no point brute-forcing this service! Work out the pattern logic, and let us know if you face any issues!**
