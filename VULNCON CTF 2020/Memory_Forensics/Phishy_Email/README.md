Description:
To make things easy for me, **D E V I N E R** told me that he got an email and he believes that the backdoor is installed from that email. Now it's your job to find out from where that email was sent. He is using desktop application for email.

***Note: He only remembers that there was smiley sign i.e. ":)" in the email.***
