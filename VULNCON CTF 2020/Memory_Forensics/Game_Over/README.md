Description:
My friend `D E V I N E R` was searching for shortcut to earn money. He visited some online sites for that and registered there with his email, but unfortunately he infected his PC with some malware. He gave me the memory dump of his PC and want me to find out the installed malware and remove it. Can you find out when and which website he visited to earn money?
