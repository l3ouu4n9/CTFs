## Description:
ACME corp has contracted you to figure out how to demodulate a secret RF signal recorded with an rtl-sdr. They have recorded many identical bursts, but your job is to demodulate one of them.  
Flag format: utflag{DEMODULATED_BITSTREAM} where DEMODULATED_BITSTREAM is the actual 37 bits that were transferred over the air.
file format: sample rate = 180000hz , sample type = unsigned 8-bit
