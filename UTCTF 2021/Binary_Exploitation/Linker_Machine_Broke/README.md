## Description:
I think I forgot to recompile my code when libflag.so got updated. Hope that doesn't cause any problems.

* "Become Enemies with Child" wish no longer appears.
* Prevented a case where toddlers were allowed to escape a lot and wander freely.
* Added the flag

* Fish are no longer duplicated in the fridge when moving homes.
* Renamed `get_flag_v1` to `get_flag_v2`
* Televisions no longer play video after they are burned or broken.
* Sims can no longer "Try for Baby" with the Grim Reaper.
