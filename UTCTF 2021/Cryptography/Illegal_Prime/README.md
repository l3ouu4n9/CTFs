# Illegal_Prime
## Description:
The NSA published the ciphertext from a one-time-pad. Since breaking one-time-pad is so easy, I did it for you.

To avoid legal trouble I can't tell you the key. On an unrelated note I found this really cool [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_prime).
