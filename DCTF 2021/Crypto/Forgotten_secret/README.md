## Description:
Last month we hired a new junior DevOps Enginner to migrate all our services into containers.
He was super hyped about Docker and in such a hurry, that he forgot about best practices.   
You want to use one of our images? 
Sure, no problem. Just download image file, run "docker load < image" and you are ready to go!
