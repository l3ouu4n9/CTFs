Nice work finding that suspicious file! Using IcyRetina's extensive collection of Yara rules, you were able to identify that the sample is definitely malicious, but very little is known about it. Can you extract the config from the malware?

There is a chunk of encrypted data that is accessed early on in the malware's execution. That is the the malware's config.
