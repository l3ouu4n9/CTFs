Our sensors just detected another sample for the malware on an endpoint in a client's environment. There was also some suspicious network traffic flagged on the host, so we are hoping to find a live Command & Control (C2) server this time!

Thanks to the information you've uncovered throughout your analysis, our research team has learned a lot about the threat actors behind this malware, and has determined that they don't always adhere to secure coding practices. Can you find a vulnerability in the C2 communication/command protocol that would let you "borrow" files from the server? (don't worry, Legal signed off on it!)

ALERT: Another endpoint just flagged more suspicious traffic, and was able to capture a PCAP for the process that generated it! This may help you communicate with their servers.
The flag is on the C2 server at /flag
