Alice has a bad habit of using flags as her passwords. After compromising a router, you log some packets and find that she has an account on Bob's server (ssh chals.damctf.xyz -p 31725). You decide to try a man-in-the-middle attack. You set the router so that when you make a TCP connection to it, with socat TCP:chals.damctf.xyz:31726 TCP:localhost:22, her packets bound for Bob's server get redirected to your own SSH server. But she only connects to known_hosts.
