You will be provided with an AES-CBC encryptor source code.

The code let you get the encrypted text of AES_CBC_ENC(A*64 + flag + your_choice_of_input).

Also, the code let you check if your encrypted text is intact, in other words, it will decrypt your ciphertext input and will check the padding for the sanity check.

Under this condition, can you launch the padding oracle attack to this program to leak the flag?
