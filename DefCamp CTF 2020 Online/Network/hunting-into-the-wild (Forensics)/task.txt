We received a report from our colleagues that one of the computers started behaving strangely and our analyst limited the investigation (based on interviews with the employees) for the period 3.12.2020 - 4.12.2020 when he thinks the malicious events were triggered in the network system. Can you please help us learn more about the situation?

Q1. Some corrupted employees tried to dump admin passwords, using a popular script among hackers, but we don’t know exactly its name. Can you help us in the investigation? Flag format: CTF{process_name}

Q2. For us, it’s very difficult to make the difference between a legit and a malicious command using Windows native tools. Can you please identify what command was used by the attacker when downloading the malware on our system? Flag format: command line used by the attacker

Q3. We also know that the attackers used multiple attacking persistent threats & scripts when attacked our systems. Can you please help us determine what is the name of the initial script used for performing the attack? Flag format: CTF{script_name)

Q4. Victims to these attacks reported that a new admin account was created on their operating machines. What is the command used by the attacker to activate the new account? Flag format: command line
